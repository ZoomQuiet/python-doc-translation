=============================================

What is Python? Python 是什么?
------------------------------

Python is a programming language.  It's used for many different applications.
It's used in some high schools and colleges as an introductory programming
language because Python is easy to learn, but it's also used by professional
software developers at places such as Google, NASA, and Lucasfilm Ltd.

Python 是一个编程语言. 它用于很多的应用.
在某些高中和大学, 经常把 Python 作为入门的编程语言, 
因为 Python 简单易学, 但是却被很多专业的软件开发人员使用, 
像在 Google, NASA, 和 Lucasfilm Ltd.

Why is Python installed on my machine? 为什么在我的机器上安装了 Python?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

If you find Python installed on your system but don't remember installing it,
there are several possible ways it could have gotten there.

如果你发现你的系统中装有 Python, 但是你却不记得安装了它,
那么可能有下面几种可能.

* Perhaps another user on the computer wanted to learn programming and installed
  it; you'll have to figure out who's been using the machine and might have
  installed it.

  可能是在此计算机上另外的用户希望学习编程, 然后安装了它;
  你可以查处谁使用了这台机器, 而谁可能装了它.

* A third-party application installed on the machine might have been written in
  Python and included a Python installation.  There are many such applications,
  from GUI programs to network servers and administrative scripts.

  一个第三方的应用在安装时可能安装了 Python, 因为该应用可能是用 Python 写的.
  有很多这样的应用, 从 GUI 程序到网络服务器以及管理员脚本.

* Some Windows machines also have Python installed.  At this writing we're aware
  of computers from Hewlett-Packard and Compaq that include Python.  Apparently
  some of HP/Compaq's administrative tools are written in Python.

  一些 Windows 机器也会安装 Python. 在写这个的时候, 我们注意到,
  Hewlett-Packard 和 Compaq 的机器会包含 Python.
  很显然, 一些 HP/Compaq 的管理工具是用 Python 写的.

* Many Unix-compatible operating systems, such as Mac OS X and some Linux
  distributions, have Python installed by default; it's included in the base
  installation.

  很多类 Unix 操作系统, 如 Mac OS X 和一些 Linux 发行版,
  默认会安装 Python; 它被包含于基本的安装包中.


Can I delete Python? 我可以删除 Python 吗?
------------------------------------------

That depends on where Python came from.

这依赖于 Python 是如何来的.

If someone installed it deliberately, you can remove it without hurting
anything.  On Windows, use the Add/Remove Programs icon in the Control Panel.

如果某些人故意安装它, 那么你可以毫无后顾之忧的删除它.
在 Windows 中, 使用控制面板中的添加删除程序来删除.

If Python was installed by a third-party application, you can also remove it,
but that application will no longer work.  You should use that application's
uninstaller rather than removing Python directly.

如果 Python 被第三方软件安装, 你同样可以删除它,
但是这个应用程序就不能用了. 你应该使用应用程序的安装包进行卸载,
而不是直接删除 Python.


If Python came with your operating system, removing it is not recommended.  If
you remove it, whatever tools were written in Python will no longer run, and
some of them might be important to you.  Reinstalling the whole system would
then be required to fix things again.

如果 Python 是你系统中的, 那么就不建议删除了.
如果你删除了它, 用 Python 写的任何工具就都不能够使用,
而且有些可能对你还很重要. 可能需要重装系统进行修复某些东西.
